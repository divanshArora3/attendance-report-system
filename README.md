# 🧠 Attendance Report System using Face Recognition

**Attendance Report System** is a Python-based application that uses **OpenCV** and **face recognition** to automatically mark student attendance through webcam input. It ensures accurate, real-time attendance logging and generates reports that can be saved for future records.

---

## 🌐 Overview

This system eliminates manual roll calls and replaces them with a facial recognition-based automated attendance system using computer vision. It identifies and verifies faces from a known dataset, marks attendance with timestamps, and exports reports in CSV format.
